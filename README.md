Portfolio model, built through a study project.

It has no responsiveness and was created based on fixed screen measurements, which can cause distortions for zoom in and zoom out.

Also, the images passed by the instructors are a bit heavy.

I intend to develop this project with responsiveness on my own. Therefore, it will be updated here.
